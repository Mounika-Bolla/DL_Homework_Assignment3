# 🧠 Autoencoder Implementation – Homework Assignment 3

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook titled `Homework_Assignment_3_700757766.ipynb`, which demonstrates the implementation of an **autoencoder** for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction.

## 📌 Overview

Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of data in an unsupervised manner. This assignment explores how autoencoders can be built and trained using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## 📓 Contents of the Notebook

The notebook includes the following major sections:

- 📥 **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  Importing and preparing data for training.

- 🧱 **Building the Autoencoder Model**  
  Defining the encoder and decoder architecture using Keras.

- ⚙️ **Model Training**  
  Compiling and training the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

- 📊 **Evaluation & Visualization**  
  - Visualizing reconstruction results  
  - Comparing input vs output  
  - Plotting loss curves

- 📝 **Conclusion**  
  Observations on the performance of the autoencoder and its reconstruction quality.

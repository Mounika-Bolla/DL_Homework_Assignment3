🧠 Autoencoder Implementation – Homework Assignment 3
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook titled Homework_Assignment_3_700757766.ipynb, which demonstrates the implementation of an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and data reconstruction.

📌 Overview
Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. This assignment explores how autoencoders can be built and trained using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

📓 Contents of the Notebook
The notebook includes the following major sections:

📥 Data Loading & Preprocessing
Importing and preparing data for training.

🧱 Building the Autoencoder Model
Defining the encoder and decoder architecture using Keras.

⚙️ Model Training
Compiling and training the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

📊 Evaluation & Visualization

Visualizing reconstruction results

Comparing input vs output

Plotting loss curves

📝 Conclusion
Observations on the performance of the autoencoder and its reconstruction quality.
